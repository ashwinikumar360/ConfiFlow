# ConfiFlow UI - Frontend Documentation

This document provides an overview and setup instructions for the ConfiFlow User Interface (UI), built using modern web technologies to deliver a responsive and intuitive user experience.

## 1. Technologies Used

The ConfiFlow UI leverages the following open-source technologies:

*   **React**: A declarative, efficient, and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows for the creation of complex UIs from small and isolated pieces of code called "components."
*   **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like `flex`, `pt-4`, `text-center`, and `rotate-90` that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup. It enables rapid UI development without writing custom CSS.
*   **Lucide React**: A collection of beautiful, pixel-perfect icons designed for React applications. These icons are highly customizable and contribute to the visual appeal of the ConfiFlow UI.
*   **Google Fonts**: A vast library of open-source fonts that are optimized for the web. They are used to ensure consistent and aesthetically pleasing typography across the application.

## 2. Project Structure

The project follows a standard React application structure, with key directories and files organized for maintainability and scalability:

```
confiflow-ui/
├── public/             # Static assets served directly by the web server
├── src/
│   ├── assets/         # Images, logos, and other static media
│   ├── components/     # Reusable React components
│   │   └── ui/         # UI components, potentially from shadcn/ui or similar libraries
│   ├── hooks/          # Custom React Hooks for encapsulating reusable logic
│   ├── lib/            # Utility functions, API clients, and other helper modules
│   ├── App.css         # Application-specific global styles
│   ├── App.jsx         # The main application component
│   ├── index.css       # Global CSS styles, including Tailwind CSS imports
│   └── main.jsx        # The entry point of the React application
├── components.json     # Configuration for UI component libraries (e.g., shadcn/ui)
├── eslint.config.js    # ESLint configuration for code linting
├── index.html          # The main HTML file, where the React app is mounted
├── package.json        # Project metadata and dependency declarations
├── pnpm-lock.yaml      # Lock file for `pnpm` package manager
└── vite.config.js      # Vite bundler configuration
```

## 3. Development Setup

To set up the ConfiFlow UI for local development, follow these steps:

### 3.1. Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js (LTS version recommended) and `pnpm` (performant Node.js package manager) installed on your system. If not, you can install `pnpm` globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

### 3.2. Installation

Navigate to the `confiflow-ui` directory and install the project dependencies:

```bash
cd confiflow-ui
pnpm install
```

### 3.3. Running the Development Server

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

This command will start a local development server, typically at `http://localhost:5173` (or another available port). The application will automatically reload in your browser as you make changes to the source code.

## 4. Building for Production

To create an optimized production build of the ConfiFlow UI, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm run build
```

This will compile and minify your React application into the `dist/` directory, ready for deployment to a static hosting service.

## 5. Deployment Considerations

The ConfiFlow UI is a static web application and can be easily deployed to various hosting platforms. The provided content mentions several free-tier options:

*   **Firebase Hosting**: Offers free hosting for static web apps with custom domains and SSL.
*   **Netlify / Vercel**: Popular platforms providing generous free tiers for static sites and React apps, including continuous deployment from Git repositories.

For more detailed deployment instructions, refer to the documentation of your chosen hosting provider.
