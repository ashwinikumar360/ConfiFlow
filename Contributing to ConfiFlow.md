## Contribution Types

### Bug Reports

When reporting bugs, please include:

- **Clear Description**: What happened vs. what you expected
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to recreate the issue
- **Environment Information**: OS, browser, Node.js/Python versions
- **Screenshots/Logs**: Visual evidence or error logs if applicable
- **Minimal Example**: Simplified code that demonstrates the issue

### Feature Requests

For new features, please provide:

- **Use Case**: Why this feature would be valuable
- **Detailed Description**: How the feature should work
- **Implementation Ideas**: Suggestions for how it might be built
- **Alternatives Considered**: Other approaches you've thought about

### Code Contributions

#### Frontend Contributions

**Technologies Used:**
- React 18 with functional components and hooks
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Lucide React for icons
- Vite for build tooling

**Guidelines:**
- Use TypeScript when possible for type safety
- Follow React best practices and hooks patterns
- Ensure responsive design for mobile compatibility
- Write unit tests for components using Jest/React Testing Library
- Follow accessibility guidelines (WCAG 2.1)

**Code Style:**
```javascript
// Use functional components with hooks
const MyComponent = ({ prop1, prop2 }) => {
  const [state, setState] = useState(initialValue);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    // Side effects here
  }, [dependencies]);
  
  return (
    <div className="flex items-center justify-between p-4">
      {/* Component content */}
    </div>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

#### Backend Contributions

**Technologies Used:**
- Flask with Blueprint organization
- SQLAlchemy for database operations
- Flask-CORS for cross-origin requests
- Python 3.11+ with type hints

**Guidelines:**
- Use type hints for function parameters and return values
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Write comprehensive docstrings for functions and classes
- Include error handling and proper HTTP status codes
- Write unit and integration tests using pytest

**Code Style:**
```python
from typing import Dict, List, Optional
from flask import Blueprint, request, jsonify

api_bp = Blueprint('api', __name__)

@api_bp.route('/endpoint', methods=['POST'])
def endpoint_function() -> Dict[str, any]:
    """
    Brief description of the endpoint.
    
    Returns:
        Dict containing response data and status information.
    """
    try:
        data = request.get_json()
        # Process data here
        return jsonify({'status': 'success', 'data': result})
    except Exception as e:
        return jsonify({'error': str(e)}), 500
```

### Documentation Contributions

Documentation improvements are always welcome:

- **API Documentation**: Update endpoint descriptions and examples
- **User Guides**: Improve installation and usage instructions
- **Code Comments**: Add or improve inline documentation
- **README Updates**: Keep project information current
- **Tutorial Content**: Create guides for common use cases

## Development Guidelines

### Commit Message Format

Use conventional commit format for clear history:

```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

**Examples:**
```
feat(ai): add support for new language model
fix(ui): resolve responsive layout issue on mobile
docs(api): update endpoint documentation
test(backend): add integration tests for workflow API
```

### Code Review Process

1. **Automated Checks**: All PRs must pass automated tests and linting
2. **Peer Review**: At least one maintainer review required
3. **Documentation**: Ensure documentation is updated for user-facing changes
4. **Testing**: New features must include appropriate tests
5. **Backwards Compatibility**: Avoid breaking changes when possible

### Testing Requirements

#### Frontend Testing
```bash
# Unit tests for components
pnpm test

# E2E tests (if applicable)
pnpm run test:e2e

# Accessibility testing
pnpm run test:a11y
```

#### Backend Testing
```bash
# Unit tests
python -m pytest tests/unit/

# Integration tests
python -m pytest tests/integration/

# API tests
python -m pytest tests/api/
```

### Performance Considerations

- **Frontend**: Optimize bundle size, lazy loading, efficient re-renders
- **Backend**: Database query optimization, caching strategies, async processing
- **AI Integration**: Model loading optimization, request batching
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of temporary files and resources

## Release Process

### Version Numbering

ConfiFlow follows Semantic Versioning (SemVer):
- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes
- **MINOR**: New features (backwards compatible)
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes (backwards compatible)

### Release Checklist

1. **Update Version Numbers**: Package.json, setup.py, documentation
2. **Update Changelog**: Document all changes since last release
3. **Run Full Test Suite**: Ensure all tests pass
4. **Update Documentation**: Reflect any API or usage changes
5. **Create Release Notes**: Highlight key features and changes
6. **Tag Release**: Create Git tag with version number

## Community

### Communication Channels

- **GitHub Issues**: Bug reports and feature requests
- **GitHub Discussions**: General questions and community chat
- **Pull Requests**: Code review and collaboration

### Getting Help

If you need help with development:

1. **Check Documentation**: Review existing docs and guides
2. **Search Issues**: Look for similar questions or problems
